### MVP TODOs:
* ~~Build the single pages (and routing)~~
* ~~Build an interface for adding and editing instructions in the admin.~~
* ~~Add loading indicator system~~
* ~~Determine how to rework creation / editing so that it's truly one at a time. They should probably be different routes, the admin should only list the different margaritas / ingredients to edit. If the create / edit pages are separate, this allows them to become user facing in the future.~~
* Look into (Parse) views as a way to filter a collection without messing with it too much
* Move all code possible from the app start and into services
* Build the proper relational database structure
* Clean up the design
* Add search / sort / browse pages
* Fix the tiny nav menu slideout / mobile view
* Combine Sign Up / Login modals like http://codyhouse.co/demo/login-signup-modal-window/#0
* Add error checking / visible warnings to the modal to make sure it doesn't close
if you haven't supplied all the info or supplied incorrect info.

### Roadmap:
* Create a user system to allow rating / saving
  * Include a social login option as well.
* Pictures of the Margaritas (removed for MVP)
* More advanced shopping list calculation / recipe features?

### Ideas:
* Ability to embed a recipe so it can be used on other sites. Similar to http://www.foodfanatic.com/recipes/eggplant-sandwich-recipe/?
